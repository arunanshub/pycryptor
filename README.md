# pycryptor 

A short, sweet, PoC Python Ransomware (+A file vault for protecting the users files)
using Advanced Encryption Standards. The program uses 
[__AES-GCM__][1] for its work. 

There are two flavors of the program, one is a [__File Vault__][2] and the other is an
effective multi-platform  __Python Ransomware__.

The `thread_locker` uses `concurrent.futures` thread pools for getting it's job done.


## A word about the lockers...

The `locker` module can be used in a standalone way in other applications. 
Initially, it was created to provide the file locking/unlocking provision 
to the app, but eventually it became mature enough to be used as a standalone API.

Here, **`pylocker.py`** uses the backend [Pycryptodome(x)][6] and **`crylocker.py`** 
uses the backend [cryptography][7].

Find the locker module's README [here][3].

A class based `locker` is also there, which is **just an experiment**. Learn more about
it [here][8].


## How fast are the lockers?

The locker's speeds are very impressive. Also, the `crylocker.py` speeds are greater
than `pylocker.py`, which can be found in [Pycryptor's backend][3].

Encryption/Decryption speeds for [`pylocker.py`][4]:

|File size|Encryption Speed (in secs.)|Decryption Speed (in secs.)|
|:-------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|  84MB   |         0.321843          |         0.313680          |
|  835MB  |         5.022431          |         4.948784          |

Encryption/Decryption speeds for [`crylocker.py`][5]:

|File Size|Encryption Speed (in secs.)|Decryption Speed (in secs.)|
|:-------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|  85MB   |         0.220274          |         0.217195          |
|  858MB  |         5.068394          |         4.854502          |

(all tested in Google Colab)


## Before you use...

File encrypted with [`crylocker.py`][5] cannot be decrypted with
[`pylocker.py`][4] module's locker and vice versa. Their implementation 
is very different from each other. 

Although I suggest you to use the `crylocker.py`. It is faster than `pylocker.py`.
