# pycryptor
A short, sweet, PoC Python Ransomware (+*A file encryptor for protecting the users files*) using Advanced Encryption Standards. The program uses the AES-GCM Mode for its work.

There are two flavors of the program, one is a simple *```File Encryptor```* and the other is a simple and effective multiplatform *```Python Ransomware```*.

Atleast, for now, the encryptor and decryptor functions doesn't use the ```threading/multiprocessing/asyncio``` modules' benifits. But work is under progress, so it is *hoped that all will be great under the hood...*

**Note: The Ransomware is meant only for educational purposes and IS NOT MEANT FOR ANY MALICIOUS PURPOSES.
I will not be responsible for any sort of damage caused to anyone's property.**
