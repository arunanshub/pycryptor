# pycryptor
A short, sweet, PoC Python Ransomware (+*A file vault for protecting the users files*) using Advanced Encryption Standards. The program uses the AES-GCM for its work.

There are two flavors of the program, one is a simple *```File Encryptor```* and the other is a simple and effective multiplatform ```Python Ransomware```. The **File Vault** was actually a school project, but the idea of ransomware came to me because of the procedure I was using for encrypting the files...

Atleast, for now, the encryptor and decryptor functions doesn't use the ```threading/multiprocessing/asyncio``` modules' benifits. But work is under progress, so it is *hoped that all will be great under the hood...*

**Note: The Ransomware is meant only for educational purposes and IS NOT MEANT FOR ANY MALICIOUS PURPOSES.
I will not be responsible for any sort of damage caused to anyone's property.**

If you notice any unwanted bugs which can (or will) spoil the party, please do let me know. And if you have suggestions for improvements, you are welcome.
